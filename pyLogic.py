#Challenge #7
#  Write a Python program that prompts the user to enter a number, and then checks if the number is between 1 and 10 (inclusive).
#  If the number is between 1 and 10, print "The number is between 1 and 10".
#  If the number is less than 1, print "The number is less than 1".
#  If the number is greater than 10, print "The number is greater than 10".
