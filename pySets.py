# Challenge 28
'''
Write a Python program that takes two sets and performs the following operations:

Find the union of the two sets
Find the intersection of the two sets
Find the difference of the two sets (set1 - set2)
Determine if set1 is a subset of set2
Determine if set2 is a superset of set1

mySet.add(value) #Adds a value to the set.
mySet.remove(value) #Removes a value from the set.

mySet.union(): #returns a new set containing all elements from both sets
mySet.intersection(): #returns a new set containing only elements that are in both sets
mySet.difference(): #returns a new set containing only elements that are in the first set but not in the second set
mySet.issubset(): #returns True if all elements of a set are contained in another set
mySet.issuperset(): #returns True if a set contains all elements of another set

#Unlike those lists & tuples, sets cannot have multiple occurrences of the same element.
