# Addition (+): Adds two operands.
# Subtraction (-): Subtracts the right operand from the left operand.
# Multiplication (*): Multiplies two operands.
# Division (/): Divides the left operand by the right operand and returns a floating-point number.

# Write a Python script to calculate the area of a rectangle. Declare two variables length and width with values of your choice.
# Calculate the area using the multiplication operator and store the result in a variable named area.
# Print the result in a format like "The area of the rectangle is [area]."
# As an extra step, calculate the perimeter of the rectangle (Perimeter = 2*(length + width)) and print it out.

length = 10
width = 42

sq_area = length * width
perimeter = 2*(length + width)

print("The area of the rectangle is: ", sq_area)
print("The perimeter of the rectangle is: ", perimeter)
