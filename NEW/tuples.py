# CHALLENGE:
# For practice, create a tuple representing a point in 3D space, for example, (x, y, z). Then:
# Print each coordinate using indexing.
# Try to change one of the coordinates to see what happens (you should encounter a TypeError).

tupleVariable = (12, 97, -2)
print("X: ", tupleVariable[0])
print("Y: ", tupleVariable[1])
print("Z: ", tupleVariable[2])
# tupleVariable[1] = 20
